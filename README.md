OtherWorld. My first game on Python
For play before post .exe file:
1st: Download this project.
2nd: Download Python from python.org (download Python on your PC or laptop with installer).
3rd: Download library PyGame from pygame.org .
4th: Right Click on Main Script > edit with IDLE > Run (it gives error) > in opened window: pip install PyGame > close window after installing > run file.
5th: When you updating to new version just run Main Script file lite in 4th , but without installing Library and Pyton (because they are installed).
